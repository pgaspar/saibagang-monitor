# Saiba Gang Monitor

**Update:** I created a new project for tracking other NFTs as well. Check it out here: https://github.com/pgaspar/solana-nft-monitor

Monitors Saiba Gang at MagicEden and Solanart marketplaces and updates data every 20min.

Check the `picks` CSVs for the best picks under 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 SOL!

Browse all data at https://flatgithub.com/pgaspar/saibagang-monitor and use "Data File" picker to select files.

Thank you [@braposo](https://github.com/braposo) for working on the original Gloom Monitor!
